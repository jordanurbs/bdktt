  I'm really into structuring information. I'm really into community networking.
  
  In recent times I've discovered passion in figuring out the challenges that arise from presenting our human experience within community-brand frameworks. We are stronger together.

  This is a place where I share my experience with one such community-brand--the <a href="https://budokon.com" target="new" rel="nofollow">Budokon Mobility Teacher Training</a>--while exploring front-end solutions to mapping out human perspectives.
