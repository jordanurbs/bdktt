I won't embellish my feelings on this assignment. It would have been my favorite, had I not unleashed a new error in my back while rehearsing this sequence. I've yet to determine the cause because I'm yet to heal from this lower back pain isolated to the left side--something brand new to my world of back pain, btw--but suffice to say it's really f*cking up the steady, healthy routine I'd been developing over the past handful of months.

It's a fun sequence, inspired a bit by yoga and some of my favorite transitions I've learned over the course of the BDK training. It's some fun with chimpanzee into a coiled dragon into a lateral pigeon balance--how do you call it?--and then an arm balance twist to S-Seat, into a classic inverted up to combat base, skip forward into a handstand, turn out and follow-through on the second side. Fun!
