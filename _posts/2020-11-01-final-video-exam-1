I messed up this assignment, because I didn't check the instructions before spending an hour producing the video and recording it. In any case, my "student" was starting at square 0 so I am happy I could dedicate myself to instructing him to getting down the basics. I was quite proud of him (and myself!) by the end of our session.

My "student" has since become unavailable to film again (he went home to Buenos Aires), and since time for filming in relative tranquility is lacking as it is, I've decided to go with the flow and post what I've got. Perhaps before this assignment is reviewed, I'll be able to add a second video of me running through 3 more transitions per primary position.
